# E-commerce-Data-Analysis for Sales Strategy

In their annual sales review meeting, Kmart, one of the largest online retailers in the US, must decide on their sales strategy for 2020 based on insights from the 2019 sales data.

This project focuses on generating key insights regarding Kmart's sales for each month of 2019. 
The data will be used to assist Kmart's sales team in fine-tuning sales strategies as the year progresses.
